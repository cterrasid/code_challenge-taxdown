# TaxDown Code Challenge

_Code challenge made to qualify for the Junior Frontend Developer position at TaxDown._

## Project Structure üìÑ

**Pages:** Contains the application pages: _Home_ and _Create User_.

**Components:** Contains reusable components with their local styles; _Styles_ differ from _Components_ because they use the **Styled** suffix. The Global styles are found in the Layout component, which wraps the entire application.

**Hooks:** Contains the custom hooks of the app.

**Context:** Contains the contexts of the app.

**Reducers:** Contains the reducers of the app.
